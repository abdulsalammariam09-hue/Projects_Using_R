 Project Overview

Constructed wetlands are widely used to mitigate agricultural pollution, but their role in carbon cycling remains uncertain.
This project quantified long term carbon dioxide (CO₂) exchange in a constructed wetland and examined how meteorological and hydrological factors influence ecosystem carbon dynamics.

Using high frequency eddy covariance data, I estimated CO₂ flux components and analyzed environmental controls to support research on climate, ecosystem services, and environmental health.
 Problem Statement

Wetlands play a critical role in carbon cycling, but their net carbon balance is highly variable and difficult to quantify due to data gaps, noise, and atmospheric conditions.
The challenge was to process large volumes of high frequency flux data, apply quality control and gap filling techniques, and generate reliable annual carbon estimates.

Objectives

Quantify net CO₂ exchange in a constructed wetland

Separate CO₂ fluxes into NEE, GPP, and ecosystem respiration (Reco)

Identify key environmental drivers influencing carbon dynamics

Translate complex environmental data into interpretable insights

Methodology

Data Preprocessing & Quality Control

Converted raw measurements (TOB3 - TOA5) for analysis readiness
Cleaned and filtered raw high frequency flux data using friction velocity (u*) thresholds
Performed gap-filling and quality control, addressing 46% missing data               
Carbon Flux Estimation

Calculated Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)
Partitioned NEE into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco)
Aggregated fluxes to daily, seasonal, and annual scale
Environmental Driver Analysis

Used Pearson correlation analysis to quantify relationships between CO₂ fluxes and environmental variables
Explored seasonal and temperature dependent patterns
Visualized relationships using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps
Footprint Analysis

Applied footprint analysis to confirm spatial representativeness of measured fluxes
Key Results

Annual net carbon balance: −251 g C/m²/year

The constructed wetland acted as a net carbon source to the atmosphere

Seasonal patterns showed higher emissions during warmer months

Footprint analysis confirmed that >70% of measured fluxes originated within the wetland area
